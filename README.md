**Anvil** is a visuals-only modlist for Skyrim Special Edition (1.6.1170) that is built around [Community Shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492). Originally crafted by Althro, it's now maintained by Bingus (former author of the [Ascensio](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Ascensio) modlist) as my own personal playground for Community Shaders related mods. So whether youâ€™re looking for a solid visual foundation to build upon or simply want to dive in and play as is, Anvil has you covered.

Twisted Skyrim is modlist for TES V: Special Edition that brings you an entirely hand-crafted suite of visuals, a total combat system overhaul, new & expanded locations, new worlds, quests, and achievements. It offers two profiles, one fully SFW for you do-gooders and streamers, and a NSFW profile featuring OStim and its addons.
