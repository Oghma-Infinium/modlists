Malignance is a lightly modded list for Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen that aims to improve what it can for a game that's partially unfinished, 12 years old and difficult to mod. It also serves as a base for extensive modding and customization, as it features an array of custom made mods designed to give players more of a choice to change things to their liking as modding DD:DA is normally extremely hard.
